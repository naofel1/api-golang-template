# Golang Hexagonal Architecture Template 💎

This repository provides a **Golang template** for building scalable and maintainable applications using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern. The goal is to present a way of creating applications with a good project structure that scales very well, using some of the best practices in the ecosystem.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a guide and collection of resources for developers who want to build scalable and maintainable applications in Go. The template showcases solving most of the real-world problems of an application in a practical way and helps developers write better applications.

**Disclaimer:**

Feel free to explore the codebase to understand the architecture and get the most value out of the repo. However, keep in mind that this is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The template is opinionated, and you should decide what works best for you and your team. Use the template as a starting point and tailor it to fit your specific needs.
