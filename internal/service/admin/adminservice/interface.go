	Angus: Now this is very interesting. You've chosen to use ent, an ORM, to model your entities, which is a valid
	choice in many circumstances. It's particularly useful for small, simple applications that you just want to get off
	the ground fast. However, this is closer to an example of the Active Record pattern rather than Hexagonal
	Architecture.

	In hexagonal architecture, handlers and repositories MUST depend ON the domain. The domain is the source of truth.
	With ORMs, the domain depends on the repository layer, and these two layers are tightly coupled. If the
	underlying database table changes, your domain model is forced to change too. But we don't want the domain to have
	any concept of changes in the underlying data source. We should be able to swap the SQL repository for NoSQL, S3, a
	websocket or even standard input, and the domain should never know the difference.

	To achieve this, the domain needs to define its own entities. A repository is an abstraction layer that translates
	the representation used by the storage to the representation required by the domain. If the underlying data source
	changes, it's the repository's responsibility to make sure it is still able to translate the data to the domain
	model.

	My recommendation would be to:
	  1. Define your entities (by hand) in the domain packages. Consider specifying separate types for,
         e.g. the input type SigninRequest and the response type Admin. Using the same mutable instance for both input
	     and return value is likely to lead to unexpected bugs ;)
	  2. For your repository layer, look into using [sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) to generate table models
		 and queries for you from raw SQL (you can also write these by hand, but it's quite boring...)
	  3. In the repository layer, implement the domain repository interfaces, translating the sqlc models to your
		 domain models.

	This is a lot of work initially, but it's the gold standard for keeping large applications maintainable.


	Naofel: I'm profoundly enlightened by your thorough analysis, as it resonates well with my experiences.
	I must admit, I'm not deeply familiar with the various architectural patterns. Could you recommend some resources
	for better understanding? I wholeheartedly agree with your insights about Ent, especially its suitability for smaller apps.
	As our table count grows, the file generation process becomes considerably time-consuming and difficult to maintain.
	Your insights on hexagonal architecture have significantly filled gaps in my knowledge, and I greatly appreciate it.
	I'm eager to apply your recommendations to my template, to achieve full compliance with hexagonal architecture. ðŸ˜„

		Angus: Something to consider: By using a concrete logger, not a logger interface, you tightly couple the
		application to both otel and zap. If you wanted to change either of those in future, you'd have to change every
		single reference throughout the application.

		It's unlikely that you'll migrate away from zap, of course. It's industry-standard and very well supported. It
		also has a distinctive interface that would be very hard to hide behind a Logger interface that you design.
		This is a totally acceptable thing to do, just be aware that that's the trade-off you're making :)

		I'll discuss how we can reduce the impact of this decision in another comment.

		Naofel: Your points are truly enlightening, and they made me consider the idea of creating our own logger wrapper,
		which could utilize zap and otel behind the scenes. This way, we could easily switch out the logger if necessary
		in the future. I've been pondering over the performance aspects as well.  I'm curious about how much of an impact
		the zero allocation approach of zap actually has. What do you think? I'm all ears for your thoughts and insights! ðŸ’¡

/*
	Angus: I think there's a slight misunderstanding about what atomic repositories are for. That's ok â€“ it's a tricky
	concept!

	The domain defines an AtomicRepository interface when it requires business logic to be executed atomically with the
	storage/retrieval of data. I.e. a transaction should only be committed after some business logic defined by the
	domain succeeds. For example, imagine a banking service where we want to deduct a transaction from a user's account,
	but ONLY if they have enough money in their account to cover it. In the same transaction, we must
		1. Fetch a user's account balance (REPO LOGIC)
		2. Check that the balance is greater than or equal to the transaction amount (BUSINESS LOGIC)
		3. Deduct the transaction amount from the balance (BUSINESS LOGIC)
		4. Save the user (REPO LOGIC).

	We can't do this using the normal Repository pattern, because we can't control when or if the BUSINESS LOGIC steps
	get executed by the repository layer.

	AtomicRepository allows us to define a callback function (AtomicOperation) containing business logic that the
	Repository promises to execute atomically with the REPO LOGIC.

	You DON'T need an AtomicRepository to execute a single REPO LOGIC operation. CreateAdmin, UpdateAdmin, FindAdminByID
	and FindAdminByLogin are all examples of REPO LOGIC operations. They don't need to be executed atomically with
	business logic, so they don't need to be wrapped in an AtomicOperation.

	Under the hood, your repository layer should execute all mutating queries inside a transaction. But the domain layer
	doesn't care about this detail. AtomicRepositories are only important when business logic needs to be executed after
	a transaction has begun, but before it is committed.

	AtomicOperations have a small performance overhead (not relevant to most applications, but it can be for
	high-performance systems), so avoiding them when they're not needed is a good idea.

	Naofel: Naofel: Ah, I'm starting to get a clearer picture now. Initially, I only needed to implement a simple Repository for my work,
	but as some of our logic required atomic operations, I thought it would be a good idea to incorporate it into the interface. Your
	Medium article about implementing AtomicRepository was very informative, but I couldn't quite find a way to maintain both functionalities
	with ent. Hence, I stuck with AtomicRepository. Your example has been a great help in understanding the true role of AtomicRepository - it
	really clears things up! Now I understand it's specifically needed when our business logic has to be executed after a transaction has begun,
	but before it's committed. It seems I may have overused it for simple operations too. ðŸ˜„ This has been a great learning experience! Thank you!
